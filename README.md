Tools to create and manage control voltages for analog synthesis through an audio interface.


## Approaches in this collection of tools
To generate control voltages (CV) digitally, we use a DC-coupled audio interface. So far, multichannel interfaces from MOOG were successfully tested. To generate audio signals that will be converted by the audio interface into CV digital tools are required. The following approaches are being tested.

### Reaper plugins
### PureData patch
### Application
